Hi, my name is 庹攸隶 (Youli TUO). I am currently a postdoc in the [Insight-HXMT](http://hxmten.ihep.ac.cn) team at the [Institute of High Energy Physics](http://english.ihep.cas.cn) (IHEP), Chinese Academy of Science. I received my Ph.D from IHEP in Spectember 2020 on the topic of properties of X-ray pulsar observed by Chinese first X-ray satellite Insight-HXMT.

I am currently in charge of the development of the data analysis software for SVOM/GRM, which is a gamma-ray burst monitor onboard the SVOM satellite.
After the launch of HXMT in 2017, I was responsible for the maintenance of HXMT Data Analyasis Software (HXMTDAS), and developed the pipeline software in Python to make it easier for users to utilize HXMT's data. 

My research interests mainly focus on 
1. the observation and the interpretation of high-energy phenomena including X-ray pulsars, black holes, and Gamma-ray bursts;
3. timing calibration on the instruments and the X-ray binary timing properties;
4. deep learning on X-ray data mining, and enhancing the potential scientific output of the instruments.
