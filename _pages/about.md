"Greetings, I am Youli TUO (庹攸隶), serving as a postdoctoral researcher within Institut für Astronomie und Astrophysik (IAAT) at the University of Tübingen. I received a Ph.D. degree from the Institute of High Energy Physics in 2020, during which I delved into the intricacies of X-ray pulsars as observed by Insight-HXMT, the first X-ray satellite launched by China.

My scholarly pursuits are now intricately aligned with unraveling the timing properties of pulsars alongside the innovation of state-of-art software solutions for the astrophysics discipline. My research endeavors encompass:

1. Investigating pulsar glitches and elucidating their underlying physical mechanisms.
2. Refining timing calibration techniques for instruments and exploring the timing properties of X-ray binaries.
3. Applying deep learning methodologies to mine X-ray data, aiming to amplify the scientific yield of observational instruments.
4. Developing NeuSpec, a cutting-edge spectral fitting tool that integrates neural networks with spectral analysis, setting new standards in the field.

My work stands at the intersection of observational astrophysics and technological advancement, striving to push the boundaries of our understanding of the High Energy Universe through precision and innovation."
