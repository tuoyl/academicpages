Since the discovery of the Be/X-ray binary Swift J0243.6+6124 in an outburst showing up around 2017 October 3, Insight-HXMT has continuously monitored on this source in a broad energy band covering roughly 1-250 keV. With these observations the orbital ephemeris of the system are derived and refined later on, according to the variability of the spin frequency, which denotes a canonical Doppler effect endorsed by the orbital motion in a NS binary system. We therefore estimate the orbital ephemeris of Swift 0243.6+6124, thanks to the long term observations from Insight-HXMT. The orbital parameters are then obtained by us with a period around 27.35 days, a semi-major axis around 199 light-seconds, an eccentricity around 0.0842. We find from Insight-HXMT data that, both the pulse profile and phase-resolved spectrum evolve strongly with luminosity, which points to the complexity of the outburst exhibited by Swift J0243.6+6124.
