The rotation-powered pulsar (RPP) PSR B0540-69, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, exhibits a rotation frequency of approximately 19.6 Hz. Around 2023-07-17, we observed an abrupt decrease in this frequency utilizing X-ray observation, indicating a spin-down glitch. Notably, the pulsar remained radiatively quiescent during the glitch event, as no significant variations in pulsed flux were detected.
